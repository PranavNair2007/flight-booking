#Flight Booking Management System This Python-based terminal application provides a streamlined workflow for managing airline reservations. It features a robust seat mapping system, allowing users to visualize seat availability (e.g., Business vs. Economy) before booking. Key functionalities include real-time seat availability checks, passenger record management, and persistent storage—automatically logging successful transactions to a local file. The system utilizes an object-oriented approach to handle flight data, ensuring a scalable and organized codebase.

Dynamic Seat Mapping: Visualize the cabin layout and current occupancy in the terminal.

Tiered Pricing: Support for different seat classes (Business/Economy) with unique pricing.

Data Persistence: Automatically saves booking receipts to bookings.txt and maintains an activity log.

Input Validation: Handles seat formatting (e.g., "1A") and flight lookup to ensure data integrity.
